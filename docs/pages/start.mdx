# Create your first plugin
In this guide you will learn how to create your first plugin. You'll see, it's actually very easy!

## The algorithm
Let's start with the main piece of your plugin: the algorithm. This is the very reason of your plugin. So we've tried to make your life as easy as possible by proposing a very simple model to implement your code: nothing. That's right! You make your own algorithm, so why impose a particular structure?

Once you have your algorithm, you'll have to explain to CTO UI how it works. To do this, you need to create a class that we'll call "Algorithm" (although you can name it whatever you want).

```js highlight=5,13,21
class Algorithm {
    /**
     * You need to implement a constructor that will store the bindings. This way, you will be able to access them later.
     */
    constructor(bindings) {
        this.bindings = bindings;
    }
    /**
     * Create an encode method that must set the output by itself. You do this by accessing `output.value` in your bindings.
     * 
     * This way, we can ensure that only the ouput is re-rendered.
     */
    encode() {
        this.bindings.output.value = yourEncodeMethod(this.bindings.input.value) // Access the input value from the bindings
    }
    /**
     * (Optional, only if you want to encode and decode)
     * 
     * Same thing as the encode method but this time you need to set the input.
     */
    decode() {
        this.bindings.input.value = yourDecodeMethod(this.bindings.input.value)
    }
}
```

## Configuration
CTO UI needs a configuration object to understand how you want your plugin to work. This is where you will be able to customize almost everything.

The configuration object is organized in a simple way: each key is associated with a view. And these views are organized in the order you specified (i.e. the first element in the configuration object will appear first in the page). You will also need to define a `parent` entry that represents where the plugin should be rendered.

CTO UI already has pre-designed components that you can use.

```js highlight=4,10
import {
    IO,
    Direction
} from "@cryptool/cto-ui"; // Make sure to import the components from the package

const configuration = {
    input: IO.Text,
    direction: Direction.Both,
    output: IO.Text,
    parent: window.document.querySelector(".plugin") // Where the plugin will be rendered. Not an actual view.
}
```
<Callout emoji="âœ…">
  If you're using CTO UI's template, the parent entry will be `window.document.querySelector(".plugin")`. This is because each plugin must provide an entry HTML file in CTO. The template includes this HTML file for you. Otherwise, if you want to use a custom HTML file, make sure to select the correct element.
  > Also, make sure that the element is empty otherwise its content will be cleared at render time.
</Callout>

## Rendering
CTO UI exports a main object responsible for rendering and updating your plugin: `PluginUI`. This object has a `render' method that will be used to generate the interface.

PluginUI is compatible with server rendering (with jsDOM), so it is necessary to tell it the context it is in, taking care to add `window` as an argument to `.render()`.

So in the end you should write:
```js
import { PluginUI } from "@cryptool/cto-ui"; // Make sure to import from the package

const plugin = new PluginUI(Algorithm, configuration)

plugin.render(window)
```
